After spending 15 years as a diesel technician, I decided to pursue my passion for web design and technology. I've always been fascinated by how things work under the hood, and that curiosity has driven me to become a skilled problem solver. Now, as a software developer, I bring that problem-solving experience to every project I work on. I love the challenge of taking an idea and turning it into a tangible product that people can use and enjoy. Outside of coding you can usually find me on the golf course, in the mountains Snowboarding or hiking with my dogs.</p>

It was such an incredible learning experience for me that I would love to join or organize an immersive coding training opportunity in the future. This is what my bootcamp experience looks like: -->
